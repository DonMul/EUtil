# EUtil (Extended Utils)
## What is it?
It is just a collection of handy functionality that was made in the passing of time. Usually i make these for some reason and just add the functionality to this library.

## I want a function in this
Sure, just let me know and i'll try to add it (or you can submit a pull request).
